# Martingale Gambling Algorithm
## The Website
This is a simple website composed of html, css and javascript code to generate the martingale algorithm depending on your set rules.  
The rules are set by the following parameters:  
* Profit  
This is the profit for each winning.  
* Odd  
This is the bet multiplier used in each bet.    
* Entries  
This is the number of lines you want to generate with your algorithm. This is dependent on the limit set in the next step below.  
* Limit  
This is the limit to the maximum stake that you or the platform you are using can handle. This may limit the number of entries generated.  

## The Extension  
This is a chrome extension to automate your betting system. The extension has a number of modifications to allow you flexibility and help you stay on the safe side.  
The customisations include:  
* The input of the website algorithm above.  
* Array filler to hold the stake values for each iteration.  
* Ability to have some dummy runs first before beginning your active bets.  
* Ability to have some cheat stake skip to boost your winnings some steps along the way.
* Observing html element changes to control your extension behaviour.
